Feeding Frenzy - README
=======================

How to Play:
------------
- Use the arrow keys to move your orange player fish around the screen.
- Your goal is to eat the gray background fish that are smaller than you.
- If you collide with a background fish that is bigger than you, you lose!
- As you eat fish, your fish grows in size. Try to become bigger than all the background fish!
- The game ends with a win screen if your fish becomes larger than the biggest possible background fish.
- The game ends with a lose screen if you are eaten by a bigger fish.
- Both the player fish and the background fish loop around, so when they exit from one side they re-enter the screen on the other.
- Background fish can enter the scene from the right or the left.

Controls:
---------
- Arrow keys: Move the player fish (hold for continuous movement, can move diagonally)

Scoreboard:
-----------
- The top of the screen shows your current size and the size to beat.

Extra Credit Features Implemented:
----------------------------------
1. Inertia:
   - When you let go of the arrow keys, your fish does not stop immediately.
   - The fish drifts and gradually slows to a halt, simulating inertia.
   
2. Even more Inertia:
   - The bigger the player gets, the harder it becomes to accelerate the fish...and also to stop!

3. Scoring Based on Fish Size:
   - Eating bigger fish is worth more than eating several little fish.
   - Your score increases by the size of the fish you eat, so eating a large fish gives a bigger boost than eating many small ones.

Enjoy the game! :)
